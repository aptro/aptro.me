Read a wonderful book by Doug McGuff and John Little: [Body by science](https://www.amazon.in/Body-Science-John-Little/dp/0071597174/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=body+by+science&qid=1626019444&sr=8-1). The book talks about science and the craft of building muscles. Doug and John lay down Why it's important to build muscle, how to do exercise effectively, and how muscle mass affects metabolism.

The book talks about five sets of compound exercises that covers the majority of functional muscles. They named it `The big five, Index fund of exercise`.
There are two variations. One with Machines, one with Free weights(barbell and plates).

I do the `big five` one to two times a week with free weights. The entire setup costs around 30k INR (400$).

## With Machines
