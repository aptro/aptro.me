## Resources on system design and managing complexity

### Books

1. **[Antifragile](https://www.amazon.in/Antifragile-Things-that-Gain-Disorder/dp/0141038225/ref=sr_1_2?crid=1JJIZ3U69JH04&dchild=1&keywords=antifragile&qid=1609835359&sprefix=antifreeze%2Caps%2C877&sr=8-2) - Nasim Nischolos Taleb**<br>
    Goto book on dealing with uncertainity and building robost systems

1. **[Getting Real](https://basecamp.com/gettingreal) - DHH, Jason Fried**<br>
   If you are building information porductions and didn't read this one, drop everything and read this.

2. **[The Mythical Man-month](https://www.amazon.in/Mythical-Man-Month-Anniversary-Software-Engineering-ebook/dp/B00B8USS14/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1609835404&sr=8-1) - Frederick P. Brooks Jr**<br>
    Core idea is putting more people to a project doesn’t necessarily increases delivery time. This is more true for software products. Every one should read if you are part of Software program, especially “The Managers”

3. **[Thinking in systems](https://www.amazon.in/Thinking-Systems-Donella-H-Meadows/dp/1603580557/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=thinking+in+systems&qid=1609835442&sr=8-1) - Donella Meadows**<br>

4. **[Don't make me think](https://www.amazon.in/Dont-Make-Think-Revisited-Usability/dp/9332542864/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3QO9UC9NHAJCY&dchild=1&keywords=don+t+make+me+think%2C+revisited&qid=1609835504&sprefix=Don%27t+make+me+%2Caps%2C303&sr=8-1) - Steve Krug**
    Common sense approch to building user interfaces. The book outlines what we think about what we have created vs what have users perceived.

5. **[The design of everything](https://www.amazon.in/Design-Everyday-Things-Don-Norman/dp/0465050654/ref=sr_1_2?crid=3GHLL95Y1FGU2&dchild=1&keywords=the+design+of+everyday+things+by+don+norman&qid=1609835679&sprefix=the+design+of+%2Caps%2C303&sr=8-2) - Don Norman**
   Norman point out from first principles just how badly designed a lot of our environment is.

### Articles, Papers, Videos

1. **[How to build good software](https://www.csc.gov.sg/articles/how-to-build-good-software) – Li Hongyi**<br>
    The take away from this is building software boils downs to managing complexity. “Software Is about Developing Knowledge More than Writing Code” – Li Hongyi.

1. **[Christopher Alexander: A Primer](https://vimeo.com/491222729) – Ryan Singer**<br>
    Video Lecture introducing the work of Christopher Alexander by @rjs. Speaks about the core concepts of form, fit, context, and how to navigate the fifteen books written by Christopher Alexander. A lot of pointers to start from and connect the dots.

1. **[Resilience in Complex Adaptive Systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGLYEDpNu60) - Richard Cook**<br>
    Lecture on why systems don’t fail(or fail?). Introduces to the Rasmussen’s system model and how to think about safety critical systems

1. **[Gall's Law](https://personalmba.com/galls-law/) - John Gall**<br>
    All complex systems that work evolved from simpler systems that worked. If you want to build a complex system that works, build a simpler system first, and then improve it over time.
